# Hi everyone! 
## Here will be the simulation calculator for Mac
Bugs that need to be finalized:
1. write code for the plus/minus button and percentage button;
2. With continuous use of characters, for example: 4 * 4 - 2 + 3 - the value is not displayed correctly. Think about how you can fix
3. Correct the error of the appearance of an infinite number of dots when pressed - DONE!

*Otherwise, the calculator works properly. I didn't find any other bugs*
